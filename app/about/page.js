          <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            University of Engineering & Technology Mardan (UET Mardan) was established on 7th March, 2018 by the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa under the KP Universities Act. The University Campus is situated on main Charsada Road, Mardan spreading over an area of 172 Kanals. Previously, the Campus had been operational since 2002 as one of the satellite campuses of UET Peshawar. Initially, two teaching departments, i.e., Telecommunication Engineering and Computer Software Engineering were established with BSc programs. On the basis of public interest due to its location and available facilities, the campus showed fast pace growth in all aspects including infrastructure, laboratories, and faculty. In addition to MSc and PhD programs in the afore mentioned two departments, Department of Electrical Engineering was established in 2012 offering BSc Electrical Engineering in Power as well as Communication streams. Presently, about 1000 students, studying at Undergraduate and Postgraduate levels, are enrolled at UET Mardan. In 2016, Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan approved a grant of Rs. 1.336 billion for the establishment of Civil, Electrical and Mechanical Engineering Departments and to enhance facilities for the students and faculty members in the campus. This approval acts as an endorsement by the HEC on viability of the campus to function as full-fledged engineering university.

              The University of Engineering & Technology Mardan was established in 2018, and is the second Public Sector Engineering university in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, with a mission of providing quality education and preparing students to tackle the challenges of the industry. From its inception, UET Mardan has remained dedicated to serving the community by utilizing projects to solve local problems and further the common good. In a short time, UET Mardan has achieved significant success and continues to innovate through new programs that offer a contemporary curriculum, research opportunities, student engagement, practical training, faculty development, international collaborations, progress towards a state-of-the-art campus building, and industry partnerships.  
              I am pleased to note that UET Mardan has made remarkable progress in higher education by adding modern infrastructure and facilities that foster a conducive atmosphere for knowledge transfer. The university has introduced innovative research in various technologies, particularly in emerging engineering fields, to promote a high academic standard and technological advancement. It is commendable that UET Mardan is addressing the engineering technology void that has existed for several decades.  
              As Chancellor, I hope that UET Mardan continues its commitment to transforming its students into valuable graduates who will catalyze Pakistan's industrial and economic progress. I am confident that the university's unwavering commitment to technology research, education, and fostering a culture of innovation will ensure its continued success in the future.
